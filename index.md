I’m a second-year PhD student in Economics at Emory University. My research interests lie at the intersection of health, behavioral, and public economics.

I hold a BSc and an MSc in Economics from the Athens University of Economics and Business and the Barcelona School of Economics, respectively, and an MSc in Neuroeconomics from the University of Amsterdam.
